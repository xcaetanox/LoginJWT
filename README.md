Project Title: Authentication Control with JWT and Microservices Architecture using .NET Core 6

Description:

This project aims to provide a secure and efficient user authentication control system, utilizing JSON Web Token (JWT) and microservices architecture with .NET Core 6 technology. JWT is utilized to authenticate the user without the need to store login information on the server, ensuring greater security. The microservices architecture allows the project to be divided into smaller services, making it more scalable and easy to maintain. With the use of .NET Core 6, the application is modern, with support for multiple platforms and high performance, allowing integration with other technologies, providing greater flexibility for the project.

Features:

User authentication control
JWT-based authentication
Microservices architecture for scalability and ease of maintenance
Support for multiple platforms
Integration with other technologies
Installation:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Visual Studio or any other .NET Core 6 compatible IDE.
Build and run the project.
Usage:

To use the project, follow the installation steps, and utilize the API endpoints for user authentication control. The API endpoints will use JWT authentication to ensure secure communication between the client and server.
